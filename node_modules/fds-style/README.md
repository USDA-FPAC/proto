# FDS Style - a CSS Framework implementation of the FPAC Design System

USDA FPAC's **Visual Language** and **HTML/CSS Framework**, as documented by the [FPAC Design System](http://usda-fpac.github.io/fds-design-system/).

The Design System comprises of two core repositories:

1. **[fds-design-system](https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fds-style/)**: Source code for the [Design System web site](http://usda-fpac.github.io/fds-design-system), documenting the FDS Style and accompanying guidelines.
1. **[fds-style](https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fds-style/)**: Style assets (HTML, CSS, Images) available for download or install, as documented by the [Design System web site](http://usda-fpac.github.io/fds-design-system).

## Background

The components and style guide of the Design System follow industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and use the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design. They are designed for use by FPAC product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use, online experiences that are consistent to the FDS Style.

It was created and maintained within FPAC's ISSDOB/FBCSS division, and was initially influenced by the `v1.x.x` version [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) created and maintained by the wonderful folks at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

## Recent updates

Information about the most recent release can always be found in the [release history](https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fds-style/releases). We include details about significant updates and any backwards incompatible changes along with a list of all changes.

## Using fds-style assets

Two options are available for usage of fds-style HTML, CSS, Images, and Web Fonts:

* **[NPM Install](#install-using-npm)**
* **[Download ZIP](#download-zip)**

### Install using NPM

If you have `node` installed on your machine, you can use npm to install the Standards. Add `fds-style`
to your project’s `package.json` as a dependency:

```shell
npm install --save fds-style
```

The package will be installed in `node_modules/fds-style`. You can either use the un-compiled files
found in the `src/` or the compiled files in the `dist/` directory. For example, if you're interested in using the Sass files (`.scss`) you would use the `src/` directory; otherwise, `dist/` is what you want.

```
node_modules/fds-style/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── img/
│   ├── js/
│   ├── boilerplate.html
│   └── index.html
└── src/
    ├── fonts/
    ├── img/
    ├── js/
    ├── stylesheets/
    ├── boilerplate.html
    └── index.html
```

The main Sass (SCSS) source file is here:

```
node_modules/fds-style/src/stylesheets/fds-style.scss
```

The compiled and minified  CSS files' location:

```
node_modules/fds-style/dist/css/fds-style.css
node_modules/fds-style/dist/css/fds-style.min.css
```

Lastly, refer to [Using the Boilerplate](#using-the-boilerplate) for basic guidance on HTML structure.

### Download ZIP

If you don't have Node or the ability to incorporate source files into a build process (Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, etc), follow these steps to manually use the FDS Style.

Download the latest assets: **https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fds-style/releases/download/3.0.0/fds-style-3.0.0.zip**

#### 1. Visual Index

`index.html` is a Visual Index of this CSS Framework's Visual Language, including basic HTML elements expressed in that style. Viewable at http://usda-fpac.github.io/fds-style/index.html.

#### 2. Boilerplate

`boilerplate.html` provides a non-designed starting point. It serves as general guidance for the HTML structure most typically required of an FPAC digital product. Viewable at
http://usda-fpac.github.io/fds-style/boilerplate.html.

#### 3. Manually adding to your project

Add the downloaded ZIP's assets to a relevant place in your code base — likely a directory where you keep third-party libraries:

```sh
fds-style-x.x.x/
├── css/
│   ├── fds-style.css
│   ├── fds-style.css.map
│   ├── fds-style.min.css
│   └── fds-style.min.css.map
├── fonts/
├── img/
└── js/
    └── vendor/
```

Note that `fonts` and `img` must be alongside `css` as the CSS files reference them at a specific relative path; e.g., `../img/file.png`

Refer to [Using the Boilerplate](#using-the-boilerplate) for further steps.

## Using the Boilerplate

http://usda-fpac.github.io/fds-style/boilerplate.html

Reference this basic list for the general requirements for your typical HTML structure. Reviewing this list is perhaps best done while viewing its [HTML source](https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fds-style/blob/main/src/boilerplate.html).

1. HTML5 doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
1. Wrap `<html>` start element in IE conditional comment.
1. Enable Responsive Web Design via `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`.
1. Reference CSS file(s) via `<link>` tag.
1. Reference IE conditional commented JS files to polyfill features below IE9.
1. Include IE conditional commented Browser Upgrade message.
1. Include "skipnav" anchor link, with `href` attribute pointing to `<main>` element.
1. Wrap primary contents with `<main id="main-content">...</main>`.
1. Build your thing!

## Reuse of open-source style guides

This Design System was initially based on the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) created and maintained by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) designers and developers.

The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public. To learn more about the project, check out [their blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/).
